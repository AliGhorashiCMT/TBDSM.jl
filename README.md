## Tight Binding Dielectric Solving Module


A Julia interface with Pybinding for tight binding calculations. The primary purpose of this package is for dielectric calculations with simple tight binding models. Analogous to jdftx_to_plot.

##Installation 
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/thchr/Crystalline.jl
```
which will make Crystalline.jl available via 
```julia
julia> using Crystalline
```
